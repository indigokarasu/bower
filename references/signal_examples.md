# Bower Signal Emission Examples

Bower emits structured signals to Elephas for all entities and artifacts encountered during scans. Drive content is inherently user-owned — the user put it there, organized it, and chose to keep it — so all signals are emitted with `user_relevance: "user"`.

Signal files are written to the `signal` payload field in the journal entry. Bower writes signals during `bower.scan.deep` and `bower.scan.light` as entities are encountered. Duplicate signals for the same Drive artifact are deduplicated by `file_id`; Bower updates the existing signal rather than creating a new one when metadata changes (e.g., last modified date, sharing status).

## Signal types emitted

- **Thing/DigitalArtifact** — One signal per document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, image, or other file. Includes file type, MIME type, Drive path, last modified timestamp, sharing status, and content summary.
- **Entity/Person** — One signal per unique person encountered across shared-with metadata, document mentions, and collaborator lists. Deduplicated by email address.
- **Place** — One signal per location found in document content (travel itineraries, address lists, venue info, property documents).
- **Concept/Event** — One signal per event or project detected from document clusters (e.g., a folder of wedding documents, a project with multiple deliverables).
- **Concept/Idea** — One signal per theme or topic reflected by folder structure and document content patterns (e.g., sustained interest in cooking across recipe folders, research into home renovation).
